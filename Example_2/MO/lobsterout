spillings for spin channel 1
abs. charge spilling:   1.17%

spillings for spin channel 2
abs. charge spilling:   1.41%

NOTE: The spilling is a measure for the relocation, *not* the absence of electrons.
number of electrons recovered by projection: 47.9997 of 48

Setting up molecule fragments... found 1 manually defined molecule fragments...
INFO: No errors detected in LCFO definition...
automatically searching point group for molecule CN2
point group of molecule CN2 is Duh
INFO: Some atoms were missing in the LCFO basis you defined.
INFO: In order to avoid problems with matrix handling later, 
INFO: I added each remaining atom as a new fragment.
INFO: This is NOT an error. 
Transforming AO basis to MO basis...
Writing fragment molecular orbitals
INFO: You did not specify a value for the point density
INFO: using the gridDensityForPrinting keyword.
INFO: Therefore, I will use the default value of 0.05.
INFO: You did not specify a value for the point density
INFO: using the gridBufferForPrinting keyword.
INFO: Therefore, I will use the default value of 0.97 Angstroms.
