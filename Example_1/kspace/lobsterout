INFO: There are more PAW bands than local basis functions available.
INFO: To prevent trouble in orthonormalization and Hamiltonian reconstruction
INFO: the PAW bands from 37 and upwards will be ignored.
setting up CO interactions...
WARNING: You did not specify any COHP pairs in the lobsterin file. As default
WARNING: I will try to find any pairs between 1.0 and 3.0 A distance,
WARNING: but that might be wrong. If you want pCOHPs or pCOOPs, change the lobsterin!
 found 13 interactions.
projecting...
WARNING: Cannot use the tetrahedron method for k-space integration and must fall
WARNING: back to Gaussian smearing which can take significantly longer. Make
WARNING: sure to use the tetrahedron method whenever applicable.

WARNING: 261 of 1451 k-points could not be orthonormalized with an accuracy of 1.0E-5.
WARNING: Generally, this is not a critical error. But to help you analyze it,
WARNING: I dumped the band overlap matrices to the file bandOverlaps.lobster.
WARNING: Please check how much they deviate from the identity matrix and decide to
WARNING: use your results only, if you are sure that this is ok.

abs. charge spilling:   1.28%

NOTE: The spilling is a measure for the relocation, *not* the absence of electrons.
